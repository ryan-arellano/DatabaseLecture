# MySQL IS NULL

## Introduction to MySQL IS NULL operator

To test whether a value is NULL or not, you use the IS NULL operator. Hereâ€™s the basic syntax of the IS NULL operator:

```sql
value IS NULL
```

If the value is NULL, the expression returns true. Otherwise, it returns false.

Note that MySQL does not have a built-in BOOLEAN type. It uses the TINYINT(1) to represent the BOOLEAN values i.e., true means 1 and false means 0.

Because the IS NULL is a comparison operator, you can use it anywhere that an operator can be used e.g., in the SELECT or WHERE clause.

See the following example:

```sql
SELECT 1 IS NULL,  -- 0
       0 IS NULL,  -- 0
       NULL IS NULL; -- 1
```

To check if a value is not NULL, you use IS NOT NULL operator:

```sql
value IS NOT NULL
```

This expression returns true (1) if the value is not NULL. Otherwise, it returns false (0).

Consider the following example:

```sql
SELECT 1 IS NOT NULL, -- 1
       0 IS NOT NULL, -- 1
       NULL IS NOT NULL; -- 0
```

## MySQL IS NULL examples

We will use the customers table in the sample database for the demonstration.

The following query uses the IS NULL operator to find customers who do not have a sales representative:

```sql
SELECT
    customerName,
    country,
    salesrepemployeenumber
FROM
    customers
WHERE
    salesrepemployeenumber IS NULL
ORDER BY
    customerName;

```

This example uses the IS NOT NULL operator to get the customers who have a sales representative:

```sql
SELECT
    customerName,
    country,
    salesrepemployeenumber
FROM
    customers
WHERE
    salesrepemployeenumber IS NOT NULL
ORDER BY
   customerName;
```

## Summary

- Use the IS NULL operator to test if a value is NULL or not. The IS NULL operator returns one if a value is NULL.
- The IS NOT NULL returns one if a value is not NULL.
